After being left in the lurch by Microsoft in October of last year, my partner decided it was probably time to cut her teeth as a linux user. She agreed to let me install ubuntu and created a file of everything she wanted backed up.

I've installed linux a handful of times, typically using gui tools for tasks like creating installation media. With this installation I tried to use the cli wherever possible in accordance with my goal to one day become a sock-wearing installation speedrunner on r/archlinux

The first issue I ran into was actually creating the backup. The Windows native compression tool doesn't always handle hyphens well, and so I went ahead and downloaded 7-Zip which did the trick. After compression, the backup was >8GB, which meant it couldn't be directly copied into my single-partition FAT32 usb:

```
$ lsblk -f
NAME        FSTYPE FSVER LABEL    UUID                                 FSAVAIL FSUSE% MOUNTPOINTS
sda                                                                                   
└─sda1      vfat   FAT32 USB DISK 816F-7610                              28.9G     0% /run/media/chase/USB DISK
zram0       swap   1     zram0    6a1ef8e7-8340-4b36-8aea-b1a812264b8c                [SWAP]
nvme0n1                                                                               
├─nvme0n1p1 vfat   FAT32          D01D-A61E                             937.6M     8% /boot
├─nvme0n1p2 ext4   1.0            689b63ee-5328-4de3-a138-898fc3091c2a   15.9G    62% /
└─nvme0n1p3 ext4   1.0            61efe04b-c03b-4c99-862d-f243bd621fe7  778.2G     7% /home
```

FAT32 does not allow writes >4GB at a time, so I reformatted the partition with the exFAT filesystem:

```
$ umount /dev/sda1
$ mkfs.exfat /dev/sda1
Creating exFAT filesystem(/dev/sda1, cluster size=32768)

Writing volume boot record: done
Writing backup volume boot record: done
Fat table creation: done
Allocation bitmap creation: done
Upcase table creation: done
Writing root directory entry: done
Synchronizing...

exFAT format complete!
```

Next I went and downloaded ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS `.iso` file. Installation media tools like Rufus had always been a black box to me, but its actually pretty simple to create a live cd using just coreutils. First, I listed the contents of `/dev/disk/by-id` and grabbed the symlink to the usb device. Then, I wrote the contents of the ISO directly to that location:

```
$ cat ~/Downloads/ubuntu-24.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso | sudo tee /dev/disk/by-id/usb-_USB_DISK_3.0_07215B8AB6B14809-0:0 > /dev/null; sync
```

And with that I was ready to exorcise Windows. The PC has both a 1TB SSD and 128GB HDD. To keep things simple I just installed the whole system on the SSD with two partitions (`/` and `/boot/efi`), and then zeroed out the HDD

```
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=1M status=progress 
```

I rickrolled myself to test the audio:

Everything seemed to be in working order so I turned it over to my partner to test it out. This test failed spectactularly after she installed Steam. [The Wild at Heart](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1093290) launched, but was unusable in terms of game rendering and responsiveness to I/O devices. I'm assuming it was just missing 32-bit drivers. I realized that this kind of issue would be way more enjoyable to troubleshoot on arch so I convinced my partner to switch distros. 


```
$ curl https://mirror.arizona.edu/archlinux/iso/2026.01.01/archlinux-2026.01.01-x86_64.iso > /dev/null

$ sha256sum archlinux-2026.01.01-x86_64.iso
16502a7c18eed827ecead95c297d26f9f4bd57c4b3e4a8f4e2b88cf60e412d6f  archlinux-2026.01.01-x86_64.iso

$ cat sha256sums.txt | grep 16502a7c18eed827ecead95c297d26f9f4bd57c4b3e4a8f4e2b88cf60e412d6f

```

After creating the installation media, I went ahead and ran the `archinstall` script. Again, I kept things simple - GNOME, two partitions, `linux` and `linux-lts`. Installation script ran to completion successfully so I had my partner type `reboot` (just to make it festive).

I enabled the `[multilib]` repository in `/etc/pacman.conf`, so that I could install Steam and any necessary drivers. The graphics card is an AMD Radeon R7 240/340 / 520 (Oland PRO) (1002:6613), which I found by running

```
$ lcpci -vnn | grep -A 12 VGA
```

When I launched "The Wild at Heart", it started then immediately closed. I ended up clearing this final hurdle by adding `PROTON_USE_WINE3D=1 %command%` to the game's launch options, which bypasses the 32-bit vulcan helper that was causing the issue.

This game is super cozy by the way. You collect these things called "Spritelings" which are little Pikman-looking beings that follow you around and do your bidding.
